# Green Fridge 🥰🌱

A web application that acts as your personal virtual fridge. It uses React and Python to establish a well-designed webpage.

When the website is first opened, the landing page will be presented to the user. Then they will proceed to the login page, where users can choose to log in to their existing account or create a new one. When the user logs into their account, they will see a homepage where alerts about which food items are close to expiry/ exired are displayed. In addition, we will recommend recipes to the user based on the close to expiry food items in their fridge. The user can also choose to upload a picture of their reciepts/ manually enter new food items purchased. 

## Inspiration
Our inspiration came from the concept of sustainability.

“According to the National Zero Waste Council's research on household food waste in Canada, almost 2.2 million tonnes of edible food is wasted each year, costing Canadians in excess of $17 billion.” ---- City of Toronto

We can see that there is a huge economic cost AND causes environmental impacts!
So, what we want to do is making a friendly app that reminds people to consume their food on time. 
Imagine you are in a really busy term, and you pay less attention on minor tasks such as cooking. It is very easy for you to forgot to eat something or let it expire. Green Fridge is here to help! Other than manage the expiry dates for you, it also provides you relevant food recipes! 
This is good for reducing food wastes and also saves you money$$!
